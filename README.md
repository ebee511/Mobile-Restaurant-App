## Project-Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I added accessibility capabilites and used repsonsive design methods to ensure functionality of various devices. There is a service worker implemented to allow this app to work offline. 
 
### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository from GitHub to your local machine.

2. In the folder using terminal or a command line, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
